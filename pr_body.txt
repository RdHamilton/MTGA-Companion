## Description

This PR implements issue #11 - Add persistent statistics tracking across log sessions.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Statistics are now stored in a SQLite database at `~/.mtga-companion/data.db`
- **Match Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate match entries across log sessions using match IDs
- **All-Time Statistics**: Displays both current session and all-time statistics from the database
- **Interactive Console**: Application no longer exits immediately; waits for user to type 'exit'
- **Refresh Command**: Allows users to refresh statistics by re-reading the log file
- **Auto-Migration**: Database migrations run automatically on startup

## Changes

### Storage Layer
- Enhanced `StoreArenaStats` to extract match details from log entries
- Added match deduplication logic to check for existing matches before storing
- Extracts timestamps from log entries for accurate match timing
- Stores individual matches and games with proper relationships

### Main Application
- Initializes database with auto-migration on startup
- Stores statistics persistently after parsing log file
- Displays both current session and all-time statistics
- Added interactive console loop with commands:
  - `(empty)` or `refresh`/`r` - Refresh and display statistics
  - `exit`/`quit`/`q` - Exit the application
  - `help`/`h` - Show help message

## Database

- Uses existing SQLite schema with `matches`, `games`, and `player_stats` tables
- Automatically runs migrations on startup
- Database stored at `~/.mtga-companion/data.db`

## Testing

- Tested with existing log files
- Verified match deduplication prevents duplicate entries
- Confirmed statistics accumulate across multiple log sessions
- Tested interactive console commands
